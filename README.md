# netsh-py
netsh-py is a wrapper of Windows netsh aim to running on Win10+

In 2024.10.21, I was doing my job. I have to use everything which have preinstalled in win10 to build a portforwarding system. After simple search I realized that there is no netsh manager out of Internet. So I did it by myself and opensource it, in case of anyone need this.
